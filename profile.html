			<p>Hi ! My name is Ricky Jhonson , I'm a Creative Web Designer and Front-end Web Developer at Team Plaza.I enjoy creating eye catching solutions for web and mobile applications. </p>
			<p>I travelled a very typical path, both personally and professionally.I was born in nagpur. I speak both english and hindi fluently. I have been good at maths and science since my childhood. , stydying and obtaining a msater's degree in Computer engineering. After working in that field for a couple of years, i decide to learn design in my own  and have been working as a product engineer and frontend developer since july, 2012.</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">One of the greatest strength about being a designer with a engineer background is that not only i can handle the graphic aspects of a project, but I can fully understand, participate and even lead the technical aspects of those same projects. </p>
